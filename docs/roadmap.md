# Goals And Roadmap

## Project goals:
* Provide a smooth and reliable development experience for engineers that want to use raw SQL queries.
* Static typing: SQL queries are validated and fully usable by the typechecker.
* No magic: PgTyped is not a DSL or an ORM.

## Roadmap:
* [x] Watch mode
* [x] SQL file parsing
* [ ] Expansion inference: allow required expansions to be inferred at compile time.
* [ ] Support composite type parameters: enums, json, arrays.
* [ ] Optional runtime type checking
* [ ] A MySQL and SQLite backend
